# Portfolio v3 (React and TreeJS)

This portfolio version is the third one for me, even though it's actually three different portfolios.

In my first portfolio I already worked with TreeJS. I had something similar to what I have now in the third version: A 3D model of a desk in the Hero section. However, the rest of my first portfolio was very basic and rather outdated in design.

That was the reason why I created a completely new portfolio only 6 months later. This one had nothing to do with TreeJS. There I tried to create a nice website with snapped pages. Unfortunately, the portfolio worked great on a desktop PC, but on cell phones or generally on smaller screens some content overlapped, which is why I was not really satisfied with it.

Now here is my third version - I am very happy with it. Again with TreeJS, this time very precise and good work, I think. Also, the website is now perfectly responsive. It has several 3D models, which are nicely in line. My projects and also my professional work experience come out very nicely.

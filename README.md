# Portfolio v3 (React and TreeJS)

This portfolio version is the third one for me, even though it's actually three different portfolios.

In my first portfolio I already worked with TreeJS. I had something similar to what I have now in the third version: A 3D model of a desk in the Hero section. However, the rest of my first portfolio was very basic and rather outdated in design.

That was the reason why I created a completely new portfolio only 6 months later. This one had nothing to do with ThreeJS. There I tried to create a nice website with snapped pages. Unfortunately, the portfolio worked great on a desktop PC, but on cell phones or generally on smaller screens some content overlapped, which is why I was not really satisfied with it. Also, I was able to fix it, however, I was not very satisfied with the overall experience on the site.

Now here is my third version - I am very happy with it. Again with TreeJS, this time very precise and good work, I think. Also, the website is now perfectly responsive (feel free to correct me, if I didn't see something). Now, there is more important informations on this portfolio like my main stack of langauges and frameworks I use at the moment, my work experience, my projects and also a small contact form, of course.
